I am a Software Engineer at Exalead - Dassault Syst√®mes. We do cool stuff with search engines, come [check us out](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/exalead/)!

I have wanted to start blogging for a while now, but always felt I would be too novice in a topic to discuss it on the Web. I finally decided confronting my vision on a topic was one of the best ways to fully understand it fully, hence this blog. 

I'll mostly talk about things I encountered at work, ranging from development language tricks to why my test method was wrong. 

Feel free to contact me via Twitter if you have any questions!
