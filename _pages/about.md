I am a software engineering manager at [Concord](https://www.concord.app/) after some ten plus years as a backend software engineer. Currently, most of my work resolves around management, but also organization, making things click for anyone in our company.

However, I have always been interested in algorithms, which is why I got into computer science in the first place. And since I started working as a developer, I have also grown an interest in the craft of coding: design, architecture, you name it. But most of all, I like trying things to see how they actually function. Or go down a rabbit hole until something that has been puzzling the bejesus out of me actually brings some levels of satisfaction.

This blog will be about those experiments and technical challenges I ran into along the way. If you're a developer or tech-lover, you may find something worthwhile here, who knows?

My goal is to use this blog as a way to perfect my understanding on a given subject by clearly explaining it and then confronting that explanation to the world. In other words: comments are more than welcome!
