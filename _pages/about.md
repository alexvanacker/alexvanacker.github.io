I am a Software Developer at Exalead - Dassault Syst√®mes. We do cool stuff with search engines, like building one, come [check us out](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/exalead/)!

I have always been interested in algorithms, which is why I got into computer science in the first place. And since I started working as a developer, I have also grown an interest in the craft of coding: design, architecture, you name it. But most of all, I like trying things to see how they actually function. 

This blog will be about those experiments and technical challenges I ran into along the way. If you're a developer or tech-lover, you may find some interesting stuff here, who knows?

My goal is to use this blog as a way to perfect my understanding on a given subject by clearly explaining it and then confronting that explanation to the world. In other words: comments are more than welcome!

And if you have any questions, feel free to [contact me via Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexvanacker).
